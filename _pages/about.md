Welcome to my website! I am an Engineering Data Scientist at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Before joining Boeing, I worked as a Decision Scientist Intern at The Walt Disney Company and an Economist Intern at Moloney Securities Asset Management. I have also taught economics at Washington University in St. Louis and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

I received my PhD in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis in 2024, with a focus on quantitative macroeconomics and applied econometrics. My research interests include macroeconomics, household finance, and entrepreneurship. Currently, I study how household bankruptcy impacts U.S. entrepreneurship using causal inference and structural modeling.
