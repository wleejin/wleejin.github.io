	<summary>Abstract</summary>

	<div>Entrepreneurship inherently carries risk. The majority of businesses are unincorporated, meaning the business debts become personal liabilities for the owner. Consequently, when such a business falters, the owner may be incentivized to file for personal bankruptcy. This paper studies the impact of wealth protection on entrepreneurial activities. Utilizing a regression kink design, I establish a first causal link between potential debt forgiveness and entrepreneurial activities. My findings indicate that more lenient debt relief policies motivate business owners to finance their enterprises. Specifically, an additional $1,000 in potential debt forgiveness increases the probability of debt financing for their businesses by up to 0.02 percentage points (5 percent), and boosts business debt size by 0.3%.   To further this investigation, I introduce a quantitative general equilibrium model of household bankruptcy, integrating occupational choice. My results indicate that generous wealth protection can potentially amplify U.S. entrepreneurial activities by reallocating capital towards more productive yet less wealthy entrepreneurs, leading to a welfare improvement.</div>
